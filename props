In React, "props" (short for properties) are a fundamental concept used for passing data from a parent component to a child component. 
They allow you to configure and customize components by providing them with data and functions. Props are read-only, meaning that a child component cannot modify the props it receives from its parent.
Here's a basic overview of how props work in React:
Parent Component: In your parent component's JSX, you can pass data to a child component by adding attributes to the child component element. These attributes represent the props.
Child Component: In the child component, you can access the props passed from the parent using the props object. You can use the values of the props in your component's rendering logic.
Props can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, objects, arrays, and even functions. You can pass multiple props to a child component by adding more attributes to the child component element.
