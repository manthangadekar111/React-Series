state in react : 
                In React, "state" refers to the data that a component manages and can change over time. It represents the dynamic information that can affect a component's behavior and appearance. 
                State allows React components to be interactive and responsive to user input.
                React components can have two types of data:
                Props (Properties): These are the inputs that are passed to a component when it's created. 
                Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified by the component itself. They are used to pass data from parent components to child components.
                State: This is internal data that a component manages and can change. State is mutable and can be updated using the setState method provided by React.
                It's typically used to store information that might change due to user interactions, server responses, or other dynamic events.

Initialize State: You define the initial state for a component using the constructor or, if you're using React hooks, the useState hook. For class components, it looks like this:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  // ...
}
For functional components using hooks:
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // ...
}
Update State: To update the state in a class component, you use the setState method:
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
For functional components with hooks, you use the state updater function:

setCount(count + 1);
