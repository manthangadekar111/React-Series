                                A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with it,
                                without requiring a full page reload. React is a popular JavaScript library for building SPAs, developed by Facebook.

what is Multi Page Applicaton :
                              In a Multi Page Application (MPA), each page is a separate HTML document, and navigating between pages typically involves full-page reloads. However,
                              you can still use React to build a Multi Page Application by incorporating React components into each page to add interactive and dynamic features.
