setState is a method that is used to update the component's state. It's used to notify React that the state of the component has changed and that it should re-render the component to reflect the updated state.
Here's how you can use setState in a React class component:

addstart = () =>{
this.setState({
count : this.state.count + 1;
});
}

so here we update count state.
