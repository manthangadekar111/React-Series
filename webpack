WebPack :

what is webpack : 
                Webpack is a popular open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is primarily used in web development to bundle together various assets, such as JavaScript files,
                CSS files, and images, into a single output file or a set of files that can be efficiently served to browsers.
                
                Webpack's main purpose is to manage the dependencies between different modules and assets in a project. It takes care of tasks like optimizing and minifying code,
                handling different file formats, and ensuring that the application's assets are loaded in the correct order and manner. This is especially important in modern web 
                development, where projects often consist of numerous JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, and other assets that need to be delivered to the browser efficiently.
                
                Webpack works by creating a dependency graph of all the modules and assets used in a project. It then uses various loaders and plugins to process these modules and 
                assets, allowing developers to perform tasks like transpilation of modern JavaScript features using Babel, compiling CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less into standard
                CSS, and optimizing images. The result is a bundled output that can be easily included in a web page.
                
                One of the key features of Webpack is its ability to support "code splitting," which allows developers to split their code into smaller 
                chunks that are loaded on-demand, improving the application's performance and reducing initial loading times.
                
                Overall, Webpack is a powerful tool that simplifies the development workflow by handling asset management, module dependencies, and optimization, 
                thereby enabling developers to create more efficient and maintainable web applications.
